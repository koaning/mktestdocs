### mktestdocs

Run pytest against markdown files/docstrings.

# Installation 

```
pip install mktestdocs
```

## Usage 

Let's say that you're using [mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) 
for your documentation. Then you're writing down markdown to explain how your Python packages work. 
It'd be a shame if a codeblock had an error in it, so it'd be 
great if you could run your unit tests against them. 

This package allows you to do _just that_. Here's an example:

```python
import pathlib
import pytest

from mktestdocs import check_md_file

# Note the use of `str`, makes for pretty output
@pytest.mark.parametrize('fpath', pathlib.Path("docs").glob("**/*.md"), ids=str)
def test_files_good(fpath):
    check_md_file(fpath=fpath)
```

This will take any codeblock that starts with *\`\`\`python* and run it, checking
for any errors that might happen. This means that if your docs contain asserts, that
you get some unit-tests for free! 

## Multiple Code Blocks 

Let's suppose that you have the following markdown file: 

    This is a code block

    ```python
    from operator import add
    a = 1
    b = 2
    ```

    This code-block should run fine.

    ```python
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    ```

Then in this case the second code-block depends on the first code-block. The standard settings of `check_md_file` assume that each code-block needs to run independently. If you'd like to test markdown files with these sequential code-blocks be sure to set `memory=True`. 

```python
import pathlib

from mktestdocs import check_md_file

fpath = pathlib.Path("docs") / "multiple-code-blocks.md"

try:
    # Assume that cell-blocks are independent.
    check_md_file(fpath=fpath)
except NameError:
    # But they weren't
    pass

# Assumes that cell-blocks depend on each other.
check_md_file(fpath=fpath, memory=True)
```

## Markdown in Docstrings

You might also have docstrings written in markdown. Those can be easily checked
as well. 

```python
# I'm assuming that we've got a library called dinosaur
from dinosaur import roar, super_roar

import pytest
from mktestdocs import check_docstring

# Note the use of `__name__`, makes for pretty output
@pytest.mark.parametrize('func', [roar, super_roar], ids=lambda d: d.__name__)
def test_docstring(func):
    check_docstring(obj=func)
```

There's even some utilities for grab all the docstrings from classes that you've defined. 

```python
# I'm assuming that we've got a library called dinosaur
from dinosaur import Dinosaur

import pytest
from mktestdocs import check_docstring, get_codeblock_members

# This retrieves all methods/properties that have a docstring.
members = get_codeblock_members(Dinosaur)

# Note the use of `__qualname__`, makes for pretty output
@pytest.mark.parametrize("obj", members, ids=lambda d: d.__qualname__)
def test_member(obj):
    check_docstring(obj)
```

When you run these commands via `pytest --verbose` you should see informative test info being run. 

If you're wondering why you'd want to write markdown in a docstring feel free to check out [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings).

## Bash Support

Be default, bash code blocks are also supported. A markdown file that contains
both python and bash code blocks can have each executed separately.

    This will print the python version to the terminal

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    This will print the exact same version string

    ```python
    import sys

    print(f"Python {sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}.{sys.version_info.micro}")
    ```

This markdown could be fully tested like this

```python
import pathlib

from mktestdocs import check_md_file

fpath = pathlib.Path("docs") / "bash-support.md"

check_md_file(fpath=fpath, lang="python")
check_md_file(fpath=fpath, lang="bash")
```

## Additional Language Support

You can add support for languages other than python and bash by first
registering a new executor for that language. The `register_executor` function
takes a tag to specify the code block type supported, and a function that will
be passed any code blocks found in markdown files.

For example if you have a markdown file like this

````markdown
This is an example REST response

```json
{"body": {"results": ["spam", "eggs"]}, "errors": []}
```
````

You could create a json validator that tested the example was always valid json like this

```python
import json
import pathlib

from mktestdocs import check_md_file, register_executor

def parse_json(json_text):
    json.loads(json_text)

register_executor("json", parse_json)

check_md_file(fpath=pathlib.Path("docs") / "additional-language-support.md", lang="json")
```
